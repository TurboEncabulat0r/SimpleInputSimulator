# SimpleInputSimulator
A simple way to send windows keyboard and mouse events in C++.

This was made for my project Cauldron that i am currently working on, i couldent find a simple way to send events so i mdae this.

simply import the headers and then add them to your build system.

a simple mouse move would be
`controller::MoveMouse(300, 200)`



this moves the mouse to the absolute position over a timespan.

## Linux support coming in the future!
